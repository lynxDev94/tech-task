📇 Contacts App

A React + Redux app to view, filter, and sort contacts.

🔧 Tech Stack

React + Vite + TypeScript – Fast development setup with strong typing.

Redux Toolkit (RTK Query) – Used for scalable state management and data fetching. Could’ve gone with plain fetch/AJAX, but RTK Query was chosen to showcase scalability.

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for quick and consistent styling.

Vitest + Testing Library – For unit testing. Could also use Jest or Cypress for other types of testing.

Path Aliases – Added for cleaner imports.
